# Hack4Impact

We have used Python as our priority programming language as it is easy to implement and used dynamic allacotation that will save computing cost and storage.

The Problem Statement: 
# "How to improve university experience for students such that they can keep track of their academic, extra-curricular as well as student loan issues effectively?"

We have done a simple implementation of a student portal that will facilitate the student, where they can easily track their academic background. They can easily apply for student loans and see their grades easily. The academic department of the institute will also have access to this portal, where they can easily add new students.

The home screen of the portal asks you to login as a student or sign up to register a new student. New student can only be registered by the Academics Department of the institution by entering the login password. If you login as a student, it will ask you if you want to view your transcript which contains the grades, courses and all the academic activity of the student, or it will ask if you want to apply for the student loan. If you choose to view your transcript, it will load your transcript from a file and display it. If you choose to apply for the student loan, it will ask the amount and reason for applying for the loan. It will then send an automated email to the Academics  Department of the instutute to apply for loan.
